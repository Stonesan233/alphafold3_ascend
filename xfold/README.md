# xfold: Democratize AlphaFold3

xfold is an open-source, PyTorch-based reimplementation of AlphaFold3, designed to accelerate protein structure prediction research and make cutting-edge AI technology more accessible to the scientific community.

Future developments for xfold will focus on integrating cutting-edge performance optimization techniques and advanced parallelization strategies. Our ultimate goal is to democratize AlphaFold3, empowering a broader researcher to contribute to and benefit from this transformative technology.

## Recent Developments 🚀

* **December 2024**: Successful migration to PyTorch, with validation confirming alignment with the original implementation

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Prepare the Environment

Follow the setup instructions provided in the [AlphaFold3 README](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3) to ensure dependencies are correctly installed and the AlphaFold 3 model parameters are downloaded.

### Step 2: Install xfold

Install xfold using pip:

```bash
pip install xfold
```

### Step 3: Running Predictions

Execute protein structure predictions with the following command:

```bash
python run_alphafold.py \
    --db_dir=$PATH_TO_AF3_DATASET \
    --json_path=./fold_input.json \
    --model_dir=$$PATH_TO_AF3_MODEL \
    --output_dir=./output
```
